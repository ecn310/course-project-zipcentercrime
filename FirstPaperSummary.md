How we Found it: Professor Deza suggested it to us 

Big Picture Question: Does having access to office-based mental healthcare reduce crime in the area? Can policymakers reduce crime rates by making office-based mental healthcare more accessible? 

Theory / Conceptual Framework and Research Hypotheses: "Based on the literature, we hypothesize that as the number of mental healthcare offices increases within a county, crime rates will decline and improved mental health will be the channel through which crime is reduced. Any observed reductions in crime may be attributable to a reduced propensity to commit a crime or to be a crime victim."
