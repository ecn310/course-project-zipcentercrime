    {\small In this study, we study the relationship between the distance from a substance abuse treatment center (SATC) and the number of 911 calls in the Greater Detroit area. This paper creates a framework that locates the SATCs in the Greater Detroit area and then creates rings around them at distances ranging from 50 to 2500 meters to find the number of calls within each ring. Our analysis gathers all the calls to the Detroit Police Department in 2017. Using this data, we conduct an array of t-tests to test if there is a lower likelihood of calls the further someone is from a SATC. With the help of the "City of Detroit's Open Data Portal," we can obtain information on the type of call along with precisely when and where it occurred. This paper finds the number of calls between the distance to an SATC and a 911 call. A t-test is conducted with this information to find the difference in 911 calls per ring around an SATC. We did this for all 911 calls and for calls that involved crimes. The results show that the more 911 calls and crimes reported, the closer it is to an SATC. There are various potential reasons behind this reaction, many of which this paper explores further. The potential importance of this paper comes from the relationship between 911 calls and SATCs, which could help infrastructure planning in similar urban areas.}

\section{Introduction} \label{sec:introduction}
A common concern among the general public in the United States is the increase in crime rates. According to \cite{covid_and_crime}, this number is more than fifty percent. In addition, drug usage is another public concern for the American public, especially in urban centers. This paper seeks to determine how the number of 911 calls increases or falls based on the distance to an SATC. Our hypothesis states that closer proximity to SATCs increases access to drug rehabilitation and mental health resources, which, in turn, decreases drug use. This reduction in drug usage would theoretically lead to a decrease in drug-related crimes and, consequently, fewer calls to 911. In what follows, we explore the question, "How does the distance to the closest drug rehabilitation center relate to the number of calls to 911?" 

Our hypothesis is based on the established impact of drug rehabilitation centers on community well-being. \cite{SAT_centers_and_crime} shows that the recent opening of an SATC is correlated with a decrease in all violent crimes and drug use. Studies such as \cite{drugs_and_crime}
and \cite{drugs_crime_space_time} have shown that these centers can lower crime rates and raise living standards in surrounding areas. Thus, SATCs can help the well-being of the community by doing more than preventing crime. \cite{mental_healthcare_and_crime}, an article showing that drug dependency is one of the leading causes of criminal behavior, agrees with this by showing that communities prosper through preventive measures. By reducing this dependency, SATCs improve crime rates in their neighborhoods. The lack of criminal behavior allows people to fully embrace better lives closer to their communities fully, decreasing the number of 911 calls. 

To explore the relationship between crime and SATC, we conducted a spatial analysis of Wayne County, Michigan. We mapped the locations of drug rehabilitation centers along with the 911 calls. Our results show that areas closer to SATCs had a higher number of 911 calls per square meter when compared to areas further away. Interestingly, further analysis revealed that this trend persisted even when isolating calls related to criminal activities. This data does not support our hypothesis. Nonetheless, as argued in \cite{Socioeconomic-Determinants}, a higher amount of drug usage in an area causes an increase in drug usage. Instead, we find that more 911 calls, and thus drug usage, are closer to SATCs instead of further away from them, as previously argued. 

A potential explanation for these findings could be the reluctance of wealthier communities to permit SATCs to build in their neighborhoods. They could fear that such facilities might attract individuals they perceive as a threat due to their unstable nature as addicts, as shown in \cite{mental_health_and_disability}. It is also possible that these locations are selected to be where they could have the most immediate impact. These are places that have the highest rates of crime and drug usage. It can be hypothesized that it would be worse without a nearby SATC. Most SATCs in Wayne County have been constructed within the last decade. These issues do not go away immediately. From that point of view, it is entirely logical that the SATCs would be near the places with the highest drug-related crime.

Answering this question is crucial for developing strategies to mitigate drug-related crimes along with crimes as a whole in American cities. As shown in \cite{SAT_centers_and_crime}, drugs are a significant source of civil unrest, social discord, and crime, particularly in urban areas. This is especially true in historically unsupported areas by government resources. By understanding the relationship between SATC location and emergency call frequency, we can work toward solutions that foster safer and healthier communities. Our paper attempts to provide further insight into the relationship between SATCs and crime in Detroit. In doing so, we hope to further knowledge about the field of social economics and the consequences of SATC presence in an area. However, the paper can be improved by adding more cities, seeing the relationship between the amount of 911 calls over the years, or finding a control for the nominal SATC and what would happen to a community without them. Our study shows how SATCs commonly find themselves in areas with higher rates of 911 calls. We further build off that by extrapolating on why that could be the case and what it means for the future of Wayne County.



\section{Literature Review} \label{sec:literature}
The geographical relationship between crime and access to mental health care is a widely studied topic. The results can seem conflicting based on the factors considered in the research.  For example, mental illness is associated with an increased likelihood of substance abuse, which directly and indirectly relates an increase in crime. One viable method of treating mental illness is through office-based mental healthcare. Evidence shows that increasing access to office-based mental health care by 10 mental health care provider offices in a county can lead to a 0.4\% reduction in the county crime rate (\cite{mental_healthcare_and_crime}). An increase in access to mental health care also shows a connection to participation in government disability programs. Furthermore, this effect is also evident when specifically considering access to SATC facilities. Evidence shows that increasing access to SAT facilities reduces violent crime due to the effectiveness in reducing crimes motivated by obtaining money to purchase drugs, reducing violence among those in the drug trade, and reducing drug usage which eases aggressive behavior due to drug abuse (\cite{SAT_centers_and_crime}). 

However, a significant barrier to treatment could be the price of substance abuse treatment. In a study conducted between 2002 and 2003, the median willingness to pay for drug rehabilitation is shown to be below the average cost of treatment. Moreover, the cost of drug treatment is a significant indicator of self-reported probability of enrollment (\cite{cost_of_drug_treatment}). While it is likely that cost of treatment has changed in the subsequent decades, it is still important to acknowledge barriers to treatment when considering its affects on crime rates in an urban area, such as Detroit. 

Barriers to  treatment also contribute to evidence of a positive feedback loop between drug usage, crime, and standard of living in a given area. The drug trade, specifically the sale and use of drugs in a given area has been closely linked to an increase in the crime rate in the vicinity. A case study of Miami-Dade county shows that drug activity on a given block can alter or nullify the relationship between household income and crime. Thus, drug usage can be a predictor of crime rates in a geographical area (\cite{drugs_crime_space_time}). This effect also has implications on an area's living standards. Since higher levels of drug usage leads to higher crime rates in a given geographical area, this corresponds to lower standards of living. This effect is due to the addictive properties of drugs, the poor decision making caused by drug usage, and the relationship between areas with lower standards of living and a higher tendency for those who live in those areas to turn to drugs as a means for escape (\cite{drugs_and_crime}).

Moreover, given our focus on crime it is important to understand the impact the COVID-19 Pandemic had on crime in general. Practices such as social distancing and at-home quarantines led people to spend more time in privately occupied spaces. This led to a decrease in the amount of crimes committed in a public setting, such as robbery, homicide, physical violence, etc. However, this also led to an increase in crimes committed in private settings, such as domestic violence \cite{covid_and_crime}. Since COVID-19 had a varied affect on crime for the purposes of our analysis we decided to limit our study of crime prior to the COVID-19 Pandemic.

Considering the conflicting theories on how drugs, crime, and drug treatment are related and the effects on a geographical area, we show how a SATC affects the number of 911 calls in an area which represent the perceived crime and, conversely, safety of an area. Understanding this effect will give insight into possible policies to reduce crime in an area. Furthermore, given the lack of economic research on this topic we decided to focus on a single case study, in this instance, Detroit, and the immediate surrounding communities to analyze the effects a SATC has on crime in its surrounding area. 

\section{Theoretical Analysis}
\label{sec:theory}
This paper assesses the hypothesis that the number of 911 calls increases as a person moves further away from an SATC. \cite{SAT_centers_and_crime} demonstrates how the crime rate is negatively related to the number of SATCs. As more centers open, they can provide treatment to people who previously could not receive any due to distance constraints. A decrease in dependency on emergency services was also found in conjunction with crime. The decrease in dependence on all forms of emergency services follows along with what \cite{Socioeconomic-Determinants} found: lower drug usage in an area causes the people who live there to have more stable and prosperous lives. It shows that as someone frees themselves from drug addiction and increases their socioeconomic standing, they become more productive members of society. This greater access to treatment caused overall crime rates to drop as there was a reduction in crimes motivated by drugs or getting the money to acquire more. We can connect it with the findings of \cite{drugs_and_crime}, who found that a decrease in drug use for an area positively correlates with the change in crime in the same area. This rise in both drug usage and crime causes a negatively related change in the standards of living of that area, which they found will again negatively relate to the amount of drug usage restarting the cycle. This framework allowed us to analyze our claim (see Figure 1) that the distance to the closest SATC will impact the ability to receive treatment, which will decrease the level of drug use in that area, leading to a positively related effect on drug-related crimes and also positively affecting the total number of 911.



\section{Data}
\label{sec:data}

\subsection{911 Calls in Detroit Area}

This data comes from the City of Detroit Open Data Portal's   \href{https://data.detroitmi.gov/datasets/detroitmi::police-serviced-911-calls/about}{Police Serviced 911 Calls}. It is generated by the Detroit Police Department's Crime Data Analytics when a call is placed. This data set covers 911 calls that are received by precincts around the Detroit metropolitan area from the year 2016-2022. There are 5,238,111 observations. Key variables include incident year, latitude, longitude, call category and call description. 

%Trying to add the year_freq.tex file here, not working



We isolated the observations to one year, 2017, from the original dataset so we could perform cross-sectional analysis. We chose observations from 2017 since the year a) overlaps with the second set of data and b) is before COVID-19, where crime rates statistics shifted in general \cite{covid_and_crime}. This is to eliminate COVID-19 effects from affecting our data analysis. Years 2016, 2018 and 2019 could also work for cross sectional analysis, but for simplicity, we only analyze one year in this report. Cross-sectional analysis should be applied to more years in the future. The data includes latitude and longitude variables which we used to geocode each call to a single point in space.


\subsection{Substance Abuse Treatment Centers (SATCs) in Detroit Area (Dataset 2)}

This data is from the Substance Abuse and Mental Health Services Administration (SAMHSA). Data is generated through the National Survey of Substance Abuse Treatment Services \href{https://www.samhsa.gov/data/data-we-collect/n-ssats-national-survey-substance-abuse-treatment-services}{N-SSATS}, an annual survey of all known public and private substance abuse treatment services in the United States. SAMHSA conducts this survey annually. This data covers the names and addresses of substance abuse treatment services in operation in the Detroit Metropolitan area between the years 2015 to 2021. Key variables in year, longitude, latitude, zipcode, and services provided listed in priority. There are 55 variables and 333 observations. Although there are 333 observations, there are only 115 distinct SATC names. This means that some SATC overlap between years, while others are only opened and registered for one year within this dataset. 

\subsection{Measuring Distance of each 911 Call to each SATC}

\end{wrapfigure}

We used layered data sets and geocoded their locations. Using the coordinates (longitude and latitude variables) of each point, we created two new variables. Every 911 call is assigned one SATC, the one geographically closest to it. This will prevent overlap from calls that are within range of multiple treatment centers.

We create distance rings, referred to as distance groups, and perform our analysis. We normalize the data to account for differences in total area of a distance group that may alter results. We did this by dividing the area in squared meters by the total count of 911 calls in each distance group.

We created concentric rings around each SATC. Each 911 point falls within one circle, referred to as a distance ring or distance group, and is counted towards the SATC in its circle's center. Our data is organized by SATC. There are 620,359 observations total, but only 415,216 observations within the geocoded parameters.

\section{Results}
\label{sec:result}

This paper hypothesizes that as the distance from a SATC facility increases, the number of 911 calls also increases. This means that the farther someone is from a SATC, the less access they have to treat drug addiction, so the more likely they would exhibit drug-induced behavior that results in someone calling 911. Our null hypothesis is that there is no relation between distance to an SATC and the likelihood of calling 911. We test the null hypothesis at 90\% confidence interval. 

Our group conducts two sequential pairwise t-tests to examine the statistical likelihood that one distance ring has a greater mean number of calls per SATC than the next larger ring. The first pairwise comparison table is seen in Table~\ref{tabl:Table1}. This two sample t-test examines the mean calls per SATC between each distance adjacent distance group for all 2017 calls. Our significance level is 0.10.

\textit{Distances in kilometers squared.}
\end{table}


The results of the majority of t-tests for in Table~\ref{tabl:Table1} support the rejection of the null hypothesis for eight of the two sampled t-tests. Five of the pair t-tests exhibit a p-value less than 0.01, indicating statistical significance between sequential distance rings. In addition, two of the tests show p-values less than 0.05, and one tests presents a p-value less than 0.10. These are still statistically significant, although less strong than the groups mentioned above. 

For two of the two sample t-test, we cannot reject the null hypothesis as the null hypothesis value falls within the 90\% confidence interval. The 250-500 meter and 750-1000 meter ring tests exhibit p-values of 0.491 and 0.392 respectively. These high p-values show no evidence of statistical significance in the mean values of the distance rings. These results could be due to smaller mean differences, as seen in the column Difference. T-tests that have larger difference values tend to have a smaller p-value. Smaller difference values might mean that the data doesn't vary enough to make a meaningful difference. Having larger data samples might smooth out this issue. However, it could additionally be with how close the difference groups are from each other geo-spatially. 

\begin{table}[h]

\label{tabl:Table2}
\centering\textit{Two sample t-tests of the difference in mean crime only calls per SATC per distance group.}
\textit{Distances in kilometers squared.}
\end{table}

Our group conducts the second sequential pairwise t-test with the crime only 911 call means per SATC. The pairwise comparison table is seen in Table~\ref{tabl:Table2}. Results are tested at a significance level of 0.10. 

The results of the majority of t-tests in Table~\ref{tabl:Table2} support the rejection of the null hypothesis for eight of the two sample t-tests. Four of the tests reveal p-values equal to or less than 0.01, two of the tests show p-values less than or equal to 0.05, and two of the t-tests present p-values less than 0.10. 

There are two two sample t-tests where the p-values are not statistically significant and can't reject the null hypothesis for. The 250-500 meter t-test and the 750-1000 meter t-tests have the p-values of 0.754 and 0.394 respectively. These do not fall within the 0.10 significance level. These t-tests are the same distance groups as the t-tests in Table~\ref{tabl:Table1} that were not also not statistically significant. This reflects a pattern in the mean call data per SATC for these distance groups. The same reasons listed above might apply here.

With the exception of 100-250 meter group, (p-value change from 0.056 to 0.041.), almost ever p-value in Table~\ref{tabl:Table2} is larger than the same distance group's p-value in Table~\ref{tabl:Table1}. This could be due to less observations in the dataset, decreasing the confidence in significant meaning of a difference in average calls.

The confidence intervals of 250-500 meters and 500-750 meters as well as 750-1000 meters and 1000-1250 significantly overlap. The other confidence intervals do overlap with the sequential intervals, but not visually as significantly as in the two comparisons mentioned above. These observations additionally support the p-values observed in Table 1.

\section{Discussion}
\label{sec:discussion}

One explanation for this relationship could be due to the positive feedback loop between drugs, crime, and lower standards of living in those places. SATCs may have been built in neighborhoods where there are many drug users, so it is accessible and convenient to those who need the help. Additionally, neighborhoods with higher rates of drug usage tend to have a lower standard of living. Another indication of a lower standard of living is higher crime rates, which could contribute to higher counts of 911 calls closer to an SATC. 

Additionally, Detroit may have placed SATCs in neighborhoods with lower living standards due to pressure from more affluent communities. More affluent communities tend to exhibit a "Not In My Backyard" (NIMMBY) mentality, opposing the placement of SATCs in their neighborhoods. This resistance stems from the fear or stigma residents have about drug users. They might perceive SATCs as bringing dangerous or mentally ill people into their area, impacting the safety of the area. Thus, higher standard-of-living neighborhoods tend to lobby for NIMBY policies in their communities, pushing SATC to be in areas that cannot or do not lobby these same interests.

To build off this, higher standard-of-living areas tend to have lower crime rates in general. Decreasing crime creates a positive feedback system in these neighborhoods, potentially explaining why the farther a distance ring is from a SATC, the fewer mean 911 calls there are. Those distance rings could be on the cusp or geographically in neighborhoods that do not have SATC. 
    
Another explanation for the lower frequency of 911 calls in further distance rings could be our data not counting 911 calls twice. When we geo-code the 911 calls, we assign each observation to only one SATC, the one geographically closest to it. The methodology behind labeling the SATCs is to limit the overlap some SATCs might have at the smaller distance rings. It could exaggerate our data frequencies. However, in farther distance rings, a call might be similar in distance to two SATCs but will correlate to one, when in reality, it could assign itself to either. The lack of double-counting thins the observations and data associated with farther-out distance rings. 

One significant limitation was the inability to fine-tune 911 call data to determine whether calls were directly related to drug activity. Without additional data, such as toxicology reports or detailed incident descriptions, it remains challenging to assess the role of drugs in criminal behavior or whether the crimes involved were violent. A better understanding of what calls were drug-related or induced could provide more accurate results on the relationship between drug abuse, crime, and the role of a SATC in amplifying or mitigating this. 
    
Another limitation is the population density of this urban sample. The observed pattern of 911 calls was influenced by higher population density in more urban parts of Detroit. The increase in population for these areas naturally increased the number of emergency calls. Future research should explore similar analyses in areas with varying population densities to better control for this variable and isolate the effects of proximity to SATC. 

Another limitation was the inability to create a regression line (or line of best fit) for this relationship. Since we collapsed the data multiple times, we lost variability for a regression line. First, we collapsed the data by count to get the total counts for each distance group. Then, we collapsed the data by grouping by SATC designation to get the total observations per distance group per SATC. Finally, we collapsed that data set by mean, creating mean counts of 911 calls per distance group adjusted for SATC correlation. Creating a regression line left one observation row that created Figure 4. We needed more analysis flexibility due to this data manipulation approach. In the future, a different data manipulation approach might leave more room for further data analysis. 

Our group analyzes data only from the year 2017. The lack of multiple years and the smaller data set leaves room for error. We see future research supporting these findings or a stronger pattern through these two ways: Firstly, performing cross-sectional data within multiple years. Then, compare the mean calls per SATC per distance group and identify trend lines. This option could strengthen the correlational relationships we found in this paper. Secondly, a paper could analyze time series based on the openings and closings of SATCs. This option could identify a causal impact of the presence of a SATC in a neighborhood regarding 911 calls and, subsequently, crime rates. These results could impact policymaking decisions regarding where to fund and support the placement of SATC to serve populations in need. 

\section{Conclusion}
\label{sec:conclusion}

We hypothesized that as the distance from a SATC increases, the frequency of 911 calls also increases. The closer a SATC is, the more accessible it is. This should reduce crime rates in the area, measured by 911 calls. We conducted a cross-sectional analysis to examine the overlap of 911 calls' geographical locations to their distances to their closest SATC. Our results show that contrary to our hypothesis, as distance from a SATC increases, the amount of 911 calls decreases. This distance decay relationship indicates that there is a relationship between SATC placements and 911 calls, but in the opposite direction of the original hypothesis.

\vspace{10pt}

We isolated our data from both Police Serviced 911 Calls and N-SSATS to only include observations from the year 2017. We picked this year due to an overlap in data and no potential disruptions from COVID-19. The year 2018 or 2019 from both data sets could additionally work. 

We used the ArcGISPro application to layer both 2017 datasets and geocode their locations. Using the coordinates (longitude and latitude variables) of each point, we created two new variables. Every 911 call is assigned one SATC, the one geographically closest to it. This means no observation is counted twice. 

We used Stata 18.0 to identify distance buckets, referred to as distance groups, and perform our analysis. We normalize the data to account for how differences in total area of a distance group might alter results. We did this by dividing the area by the total count of 911 calls in each distance group.
